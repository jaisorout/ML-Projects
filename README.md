This project explores the automotive industry's intricate dynamics, aiming to predict car prices with machine learning. By analyzing various factors such as fuel type, seller type, and transmission, we uncover valuable insights and select a robust model for accurate price prediction.

Key Insights:

- The 'city' model is the top-selling car, followed by 'corolla altis,' 'verna,' 'fortuner,' and 'brio,' providing a snapshot of popular car models in the market.

- The year 2015 saw the highest number of car purchases, making it the most favored year for buying cars, followed by 2016 and 2014.

- 'Petrol' is the predominant fuel type for cars in the dataset, surpassing 'Diesel' and 'CNG,' indicating fuel preference among buyers.

- The majority of cars are sold through dealers, underscoring the role of dealerships in the automotive market.

- 'Manual' transmission cars significantly outnumber 'Automatic' transmission cars, showcasing consumer transmission preferences.

- 'First Owner' cars generally command higher 'Selling_Price,' while 'Second' or 'Third Owner' cars often have lower prices.

- 'Diesel' cars tend to have higher 'Selling_Price' compared to 'Petrol' or 'CNG' vehicles, emphasizing the influence of fuel type on car pricing.

- 'Dealer' sellers usually ask for higher prices than 'Individual' sellers, revealing the impact of seller type on prices.
- 'Automatic' transmission cars typically have higher prices than their 'Manual' counterparts, reflecting consumer preferences.

- 'Owner' count plays a role in car pricing, with 'First Owner' cars being more expensive than 'Second' or 'Third Owner' cars.

- The relationship between driven kilometers and 'Selling_Price' is negative, suggesting that cars with fewer kilometers tend to have higher selling prices.

- Various machine learning models were assessed, with the Random Forest model being chosen for car price prediction due to its robust performance.

- The project used the R2 score as the primary evaluation metric to assess model accuracy.

- The Random Forest model achieved impressive accuracy with 98% training accuracy and 93% testing accuracy, making it a suitable choice for car price prediction.

The insights provide a holistic understanding of the factors influencing car prices, both from exploratory data analysis and machine learning model perspectives. The Random Forest model's accuracy underscores its potential for practical applications in the automotive market.
This project has not only equipped us with valuable data science skills but has also deepened our understanding of car pricing, making it a significant step in the field of data science and machine learning.
